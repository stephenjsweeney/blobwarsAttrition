<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Blob Wars : Attrition is a mission and objective-based 2D platformer. It is the third entry in the Blob Wars series and is set between the events of Metal Blob Solid and Blob and Conquer. The story centres around an alien invasion of the Blobs' homeworld and their fight back against the aggressors. Many of Bob's fellow blobs have been assimilated by alien technology and become evil. During the game, you take control of a blob named Bob, whose mission it is to rescue MIA and fight back against the enemy. The gameplay is non-linear, allowing the player to tackle missions in any order they like.
</p>

<h3>Quick Start Guide</h3>
<p>
To quickly start playing the game:
<ul>
	<li>Run the Blob Wars executable (./blobwarsAttrition on Linux, blobwarsAttrition.exe) on Windows).</li>
	<li>Choose New Game and select a save slot.</li>
	<li>On the world map screen, use the mouse or keyboard control to select the Beach Approach tutorial mission.</li>
	<li>Play and complete the training mission to proceed with the game (or quit the mission to proceed more quickly).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>
Blob Wars : Attrition supports both keyboard and joypad controls. A joypad must be connected to the machine before the game is started up in order for the game to correctly detect it.
</p>

</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>
Most missions in the game feature multiple objectives which are listed at the start of the level. Those objectives listed in red are required to be completed. Those listed in white are optional and can be completed at any other time. Once all the objectives have been completed, the mission will automatically end and the player will be returned to the World Map. They can then choose to return to the mission again, to complete all the outstanding objectives and collect keys that they missed before.
</p>

	</ol>
</div>
<p>
Bob starts the game with 10 health points, which are depleted as he takes damage. When Bob's health is reduced to 0, he is killed and the mission is failed. Picking up cherries will help to regain health (see further below for more information). Bob also has a power level, that is used by both the aqua lung and jetpack. This can be replenished by picking up batteries (see further below for more information). It also naturally regenerates over time.
</p>
<img src="gameplay3.jpg" class="screenshot" />
<p>
Pressing Escape anytime during gameplay will bring up a menu, allowing you to access options, stats, trophy information, and to also quit the mission.
</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="highlight">Resume</span>: continue playing the game.</li>
		<li><span class="highlight">Options</span>: access the options screen.</li>
		<li><span class="highlight">Stats</span>: view various gameplay stats.</li>
		<li><span class="highlight">Trophies</span>: view the trophies earned and outstanding.</li>
		<li><span class="highlight">Quit</span>: quit the current mission.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
The result of quitting a mission and returning to the hub depends on the current status of the mission. If the mission has never been completed, all progress will be lost and the mission will need to be restarted. If the mission has been completed before, all progress will be saved and any keys found will be taken along with the player (note that some items will be dropped in place).
</p>

<h4>Weapons</h4>
<p>
A number of weapons are at Bob's disposal:
<ul>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Pistol</span>: Bob's starting weapon. Slow to fire, but unlike all the rest can be used underwater.</li>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Plasma Rifle</span>: A rapid-firing gun that does slightly more damage than other guns in the game.</li>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Spread Gun</span>: Fires three shots in a spread effect. Most useful in wide open spaces and for hitting enemies that are slightly out of reach.</li>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Laser</span>: Cuts through enemies and bounces off walls Causes tremendous amounts of damage.</li>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Grenades</span>: Bounce and explode on contact with enemies. Causes plenty of damage (some enemies, such as cannons, are immune to the explosion).</li>
</ul>
<i>Be aware that due to the nature of the game, Bob can only change weapons by picking up a weapon icon.</i>
</p>

<h4>Cherries and Batteries</h4>
<p>
Cherries and batteries restore Bob's health and power respectively. Each come in different sizes, topping up the health and power by different amounts. A small cherry and a weak battery will refill Bob's gauges a small amount, while a bunch of berries and a full battery will restore much more. You should collect cherries and batteries as often as you can, to keep your health and power as high as possible. 
</p>

<h4>Flying and Swimming</h4>
<p>
From the start of the game, Bob is equipped with a jetpack and aqualung. When activated, the jetpack will allow Bob to fly for a short period of time, allowing him to reach higher and more distant areas. The jetpack draws on power reserves when it is activated and will automatically cut out once the power levels reach 0. When in water, Bob can swim. Swimming will slowly reduce his oxygen levels. Once the level reaches 0, Bob's health will rapidly decrease. Getting out of the water will regenerate Bob's O2 levels. Bob can also activate his aqualung to swim for longer. The aqualung will draw on Bob's power reserves and will cut out as soon as the power levels reach 0.
</p>

<h4>Keys</h4>
<p>
Keys and keycards to open doors can be found scattered throughout the missions in Attrition. Spare keys not used in a level are carried between levels once the mission ends (or the player quits). This is important, as not all the doors on one level will have a matching key. For example, a level might contain two gold doors, but only one gold key. In this instance, the player would need to find a gold key on another level.
</p>

<h4>MIAs</h4>
<p>
In some missions, Bob will encounter MIA blobs. These are your war buddies who have become too shell shocked to return home and are in need of rescue. Returning them home is easy: just walk into them. MIA blob don't attack enemies and cannot be hurt by gun fire (friend or foe), so don't worry about stray fire hitting them!
</p>

<h4>Water, Slime, and Lava</h4>
<p>
Water, slime, and lava are present in the Blobs' world. While Bob can swim in water and not suffer any ill effects (aside from drowning, if his oxygen runs out), slime and lava will reduce Bob's health if he falls in it. Slime will reduce Bob's health by 1 point, while lava will remove 2 points of health. Both should be avoided.
</p>

<h4>Hearts and Cells</h4>
<p>
Hearts and cells are special items that will increase Bob's maximum health and power by 1 point each. These items are unique and can be found in most levels in the game. Upon collecting a heart or cell, Bob's health or power will be immediately increased and restored to the new maximum. Hearts and cells are often in difficult to reach or out-of-the-way areas. Even so, you should make an effort to find them as quickly as possible as the increases in health and power will aid Bob immensely on his quest.
</p>

<h4>Teeka</h4>
<p>
Teeka is a buddy of Bob's who sometimes accompanied him on missions. He can sometimes be found on missions guarding a white keycard that is needed for boss encounters. He will leave once you collect it. Teeka can't be hurt by gun fire, but will attack enemies on sight.
</p>

<h3>Main Mission</h3>
<p>
Upon starting a mission, the objectives for that mission will be displayed. The required objectives for the mission must be completed in order for it to be passed. If the player is killed or the mission is quit, it must be replayed from the beginning.
</p>

<h4>Objectives / Inventory</h4>
<p>
At any time during gameplay, pressing Pause will display the mission's current objectives, as well as their progress. It will also display the inventory, showing items carried. Required objectives are displayed in red, completed objectives in green, and other objectives (non-required) in white. Bob may carry up to 14 items (keys only occupy one inventory slot, their numbers stacking). There is no way for Bob to drop items that he is carrying, other than to use them.

<h4>Radar</h4>
<p>
Pressing the Radar key (Tab by default) during a mission will bring up the radar screen. This will show all an extended area map of the current region. Various blips will be present, marking the location of keys, required mission items, MIAs, and mission targets (such as enemies and objects that must be destroyed). Note that the radar map does not cover the entire mission map and only extends out a little way from Bob's present location. It cannot be scrolled. However, various arrows will point in the direction of out-of-range targets. Following these arrows will lead Bob to his objectives.

		<li>Blip directional arrows</li>
		<li>Blip legend</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<h4>Ending the Game</h4>
<p>
If Bob loses all his health, the mission is failed. At this point, you will have the option to restart the mission or return to the hub. Restarting the mission will reset everything to the way it was when the mission began; keys, items, etc. will be reset to their previous state, including the player's inventory and health bonuses. In the case of a new mission, this will mean restarting from the beginning. If returning to the mission, the player will restart from that point.
</p>
<p>
Once all missions have been completed, the player will have the option to continue the game in Free Play mode. They may play any mission they like, at any time. The state of the mission will not be saved, however.
</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<p>
The options screen can be access at most times during the game. It allow you to set various preferences using the up, down, left, right controls.
</p>

<p>
<img src="options.jpg" class="screenshot" />
<ul>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Fullscreen</span>: activate the fullscreen mode for the game. Note that you must exit and restart the game in order for this change to take effect.</li>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Window Size</span>: select the window size of the game. Change this if things appear too big or too small. Note that you must exit and restart the game in order for this change to take effect.</li>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Sound Volume</span>: change the volume of the sound effect. Use the left and right controls to change the levels.</li>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Music Volume</span>: change the volume of the music. Use the left and right controls to change the levels.</li>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Blood</span>: whether or not to show blood. When blood is off, enemy blobs won't scream when they die and will also disappear in a puff of white when they are defeated. Blood will not splatter the ground. The Extra option will do the opposite and leave more blood around for longer (this might clutter the screen a little, so be careful with this option).</li>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Trophy Screenshot</span>: whether or not to save a screenshot when a trophy is earned. The screenshot is saved to the same location as the save files. Be aware that this might cause the game to pause for a moment when the screenshot to saved.</li>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Trophy Alert</span>: whether or not to show an in-game alert when a trophy is earned. Switching to to Restricted will mean that alerts are not shown during a mission. This option may be best if you find the alerts obscuring gameplay.</li>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Hud Inventory</span>: whether to show the in-game inventory in the top right corner of the screen during a mission. Turn this off if you find it either distract or is obscuring the gameplay.</li>
	<li><span class='highlight'>Controls</span>: go to the controls configuration screen. See below for more details.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<img src="controls.jpg" class="screenshot" />
</p>
<p>
To change a control, highlight the relevant options and press Return or Space, then press the keyboard control or joypad button of your choosing. Pressing backspace will clear a control setting. Note that menus can always be navigated by using the arrow keys, and by pressing Return or Space.
</p>

<h3>Hints and Tips</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Seek out Hearts and Cells as much as possible, to increase your health and power.</li>
		<li>You may exit a partially completed mission at any time. Your progress will be saved and any keys found will come with you.</li>
		<li>Enemies in Outposts are stronger and require more hits to take down. Tackle these missions with care.</li>
		<li>When swimming, wait until your oxygen is just about the run out before activating your aqualung. O2 recovers much faster than battery power.</li>
		<li>The pistol is the only weapon that can be fired underwater.</li>
		<li>Later in the game, it may be necessary to return to earlier levels to collect as many keys as possible, in order to proceed.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Misc. Game Info</h3>
<p>
Blob Wars : Attrition features an in-game trophy system, not unlike the achievement and trophy system found in Steam, Xbox Live, and PSN. This is entirely an offline system and exists purely for fun. Trophies are awarded for things such as completing missions, defeating a certain number of enemies, and rescuing MIAs. You can view the trophies you have earned and those that are outstanding in the hub and mission menus. When a trophy is earned, a notification will appear on the screen. If you find these distracting, you can switch them off in the options screen (or set them to be restricted, so that they do not appear during missions). A screenshot is also saved, which can also be turned off.
