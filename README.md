# Blob Wars : Attrition

Blob Wars : Attrition is a 2D mission and objective-based platform game. It is the third game in the Blob Wars series.

The develop branch on GitHub (https://github.com/stephenjsweeney/blobWarsAttrition/tree/develop) is where all the dev work happens. Stable(ish) releases will go in to master (https://github.com/stephenjsweeney/blobWarsAttrition/tree/master).

The source code of this game (everything under the src directory) is licensed under the GPL. www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html

### IMPORTANT

This repo does not contain any data files (maps, sprite definitions, etc). In order to play the game, you will need to purchase the data. You can do so here:

http://www.stephenjsweeney.com/games/attrition/#purchase

### DATA INSTALLATION

The data folder should be placed alongside the gfx, sound, and music folders, so that the game can access it. By default, the "make install" step will place the data files into /opt/blobWarsAttrition. This is where you should copy the data folder, in order for the game to work. Or, after building, you can run the game in place.

### DEMO DATA

Demo data files are also available and can be installed in the same way. The demo data is limited to three maps and does not define all of the game's content. Note that if you test the game with this demo data and then upgrade to the full experience, you should remove both the demo data folder and also the save games that it creates. Otherwise, due to the persistent nature of the game, you may encounter game breaking bugs.

You can download the demo data here, as either a zip or a gzip:
